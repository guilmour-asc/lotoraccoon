# Purpose
Generate **random Lottery sequences**.

The sequences shall be based on a simple text file, which contains a history of past Lottery results in Brazil (yeah, I'm this kind of lazy).

# Targeted Lotto type
- Brazilian Mega-sena;

# Lotto History's mandatory format
`NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM`

`NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM`

`NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM`

`... ... ...`

# Execution of code
> Python version (at the time): **`3.10.6`**

```shell
# MAIN FUNCTION
python src/main.py
```

# Will this app turn into something else?
I doubt, for now...

- It's pretty straight-forward, and simple.
- I did thought about making a special function to retrieve the most common numbers in this list of past Lotteries, but given the random nature of real Lotteries, it's useless in practice... or, at least, serves only as curiosity. So, it will depend if demand show up.
